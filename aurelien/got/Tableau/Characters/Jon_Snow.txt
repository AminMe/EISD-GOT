{{Quote|I’m not asking [[Karsi|you]] to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost fifty brothers the night that [[Mance Rayder|Mance]] [[Battle of Castle Black|attacked]] the Wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The [[The Long Night|Long Night]] is coming and the [[Wights|dead]] come with it. No clan can stop them. The [[Free Folk]] can’t stop them, the [[Night’s Watch]] can’t stop them and all the southern kings can’t stop them! Only together. All of us. And even then it may not be enough, but at least we give the [[White Walkers|fuckers]] a fight.|'''Jon Snow'''|Hardhome (episode)}}
