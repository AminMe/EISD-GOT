| Actor = [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]
| Age = Approx. 41 in Season 5<ref>Jaime is Cersei's twin, and thus the same age as her.  Tyrion stated in "[[The Prince of Winterfell]]" that Cersei became Queen when she was 19, at the end of Robert's Rebellion, and 17 years passed between the end of the war and Season 1.  This makes Cersei 36 in Season 1 and 39 in Season 4.  In the Season 4 premiere, Jaime is said to be "40", but characters might have been rounding.  Some contradictory statements have been made about Cersei's age:  see [[Timeline#Differences from the books|here]] for more information.</ref>
